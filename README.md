# Bachelor-Thesis

My Bachelor's Thesis files.

I got my bachelor's degree in economics at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). The thesis is all in Portuguese. It has some errors I need to fix, but here it is as I presented it.

In Brazil, the official style for writing monographs is established by Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas (ABNT). My monograph conforms to this style, and the template can be very helpful to undergraduate students writing their theses. I used the [abntex2 package](https://github.com/abntex/abntex2) to make it.
